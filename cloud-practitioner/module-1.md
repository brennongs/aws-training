# MODULE 1
*Objectives*
- summarize the benefits of AWS.
- describe the differences between on-demand delivery and cloud deployments
- summarize the pay-as-you-go pricing model

## Introduction
In computing, a client is any entity that requests resources from a server. A server is an entity that serves resources to a client.

AWS exists to fill the need of the server side of the client server model in a cheaper, easier way than traditional on-prem resources. They offer a pay-as-you-go pricing model, wherein we only pay for the compute time we consume. If our` server isn't doing anything, we shouldn't have to pay for it, and that is what AWS tries to make possible. They compare the client-server model to a coffee shop. The client is a customer, and the server is a barista. Customer makes an order to the barista, and the barista makes the order and delivers it to the customer.

In a coffee shop, we wouldn't pay our baristas to just sit around, we would send them home and save their pay for something else. That is how the pay-as-you-go pricing model works as well. If we don't need an instance or resource, we can just turn it off.

## Cloud Computing
*Cloud Computing* is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

AWS is working to enable the availability of IT resources, be it databases, servers, or domain names, on-demand, exactly when we need them. They also work to make them decommisionable when they are no longer needed, just as easily as they were provisioned in the first place. They also talk a lot about offering any resource that any business might need. 

The example here is a MySQL database. As a business, we ought to be able to focus on the part of your business that is going to get we ahead, not managing a database. So AWS provides MySQL without the management, so we can focus on designing we data instead of upgrading our resources.

### Three cloud deployment models
**Cloud-based deployment**
- run all parts of the application in the cloud
- migrate existing applications to the cloud
- design and build new applications in the cloud

**On-premises deployment**
- deploy resources by using virtualization and resource management tools
- increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualization technologies

(This is different than traditional -- legacy -- on prem deployment, because it uses virtualization and application management, and is also known as *private cloud* deployment)

**Hybrid deployment**
- connect cloud-based resources to on-premises infrastructure
- integrate cloud-based resources with legacy IT applications

### Benefits of cloud computing
**Trade upfront epense for variable expense**

*Upfront expense* refers to data centers, physical servers, and other resources that you'd need to buy before using them.

*Variable expense* means we only pay for computing resources you consume.

**Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers**

**Stop guessing capacity**

With elastic scaling, we no longer have to predict usage since we can provision resources automatically when we need them.

**Benefit from massive *economies of scale***

Because of the massive usage of AWS, they can charge less for their resources. We pay less because of massive multitenancy and aggregated usage.

**Increase speed and agility**

The flexibility of cloud computing provides us with more time to experiment and innovate. It's easy to provision resources and test things out, so we spend less time managing infrastructure and more time writing code.

**Go global in minutes**

AWS has put a ton of resources into their global footprint and covering the globe. Because of this, we have the abiblity to deploy all over the world with the push of a button, without compromising latency and availability.
