# MODULE 10
*Objectives*
- Summarize the five pillars of the Well-Architected Framework
- Explain the six benefits of cloud computing

## Well-Architected Framework
Helps us understand how to design and operate reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective systems in the AWS Cloud.

Five pillars
1. Operational Excellence - the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business fvalue and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures. Design principles include performing operations as code, annotating documentation, anticipating failure, and frequently making small, reversible changes.
2. Security - the ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business vaalue through risk assessments and mitigation strategies. Best practices: Automate security best practices when possile, apply security at all layers, protect data in transit and at rest.
3. Reliability - the ability of a system to recover from service or infrastructure or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions such as misconfigs or transient network issues. Test recovery procedures, scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability, automatically recover from failure.
4. Performance efficiency - the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve. Experiment more often, use serverless arch, design systems to go global in minutes.
5. Cost optimization - the ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point. Adopt a consumption model, analyze and attribute expenditure, and use managed services to reduce the cost of ownership.

## Benefits of the AWS Cloud
six main benefits of using the cloud
1. Trade fixed expense for variable expense
2. Benefit from massive economies of scale
3. Stop guessing capacity
4. Increase speed and agility
5. Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
6. Go global in minutes
